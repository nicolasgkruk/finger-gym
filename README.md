The goal of this project is to showcase my react.js best practices.  
React libraries used in this project: redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, react-router-dom, axios.  
Added responsive features (mobile first), although proper styling is still pending.  

This simple toy project shows many common features of any modern web application like authentication, asynchronous post and get requests, and the use of third party visualization libraries (react-google-charts in the case of this project).  

I used Firebase as a dummy backend.
